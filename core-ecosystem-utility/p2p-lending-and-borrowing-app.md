# p2p Lending and Borrowing app

#### &#x20;       Decentralized finance is the key to an open financial system, giving the masses an equal opportunity to take advantage of all the benefits that comes with defi, especially within the crypto space. Our p2p lending and borrowing platform will enable current SOLCH holders and potential holders to have access to funds and liquidity by staking their SOLCH tokens as collateral. Users will earn interest on deposits and borrow funds based on how much SOLCH they have as collateral.  The initial loan to value ratio will be set to 2:1. This means that borrowers are allowed to borrow up to half the total value of SOLCH they have staked. I.e. If a user has $1000 worth of SOLCH token staked, they can only borrow $500 worth of asset.&#x20;
